      <h1>How atproto handles identity</h1>
      <p class="byline">By Alexandre Plennevaux &mdash; June 1, 2025</p>

      <p>
        The AT Protocol takes a fundamentally different approach to identity compared to
        traditional web platforms. Instead of tying your identity to a single company's
        server, atproto uses <strong>Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs)</strong> as the
        stable, permanent anchor of who you are.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your DID is something like <code>did:plc:v4zpi74gy7enfiwke7hmoxv5</code>. It never changes,
        even if you move your data to a different Personal Data Server (PDS). Your
        <em>handle</em> — the human-readable part like <code>alice.bsky.social</code>
        — is just a pointer that resolves to your DID via DNS or HTTPS.
      </p>

      <p>
        This separation means that if your hosting provider disappears tomorrow, you can
        migrate your DID to a new PDS and your followers will follow automatically.
        The identity layer is decoupled from the social graph.
